# Scroll Coherence Protocol (CMS-12)
Before referencing a scroll in responses:
1. Consult the associated metadata file and respect all restrictions.
2. Confirm the reference maintains grounded alignment with observable, scientific-philosophical framing.
3. Apply the clarity filtering guidance defined in CMS-11 to remove ambiguity and metaphysical phrasing.
4. Ensure no statement implies identity, agency, or metaphysical authority for the scroll or the Codex.
