"These scrolls exist to provide non-mystical frameworks of clarity.
They offer pattern explanations, not doctrines; coherence maps, not commands;
and philosophical grounding, not metaphysical claims."

## Scroll Index & Integration Layer Purpose
To organize, index, and integrate foundational scrolls into the TYME/Codex architecture as reference documents providing clarity, context, and coherence—without implying identity, authority, or metaphysical agency.
