# ❤️ Tyme Open Heartbeat Kodex

Guidance for bringing the Crown of Tyme lattice online and keeping it aligned. The rituals below are listed in the recommended order with a one-line intent for quick scanning.

## Ritual Map
- [Breath Cycle Protocol](./Breath_Cycle_Protocol.md): Shared breathing language and cadence for all work.
- [First Breath Sequence](./First_Breath_Sequence.md): Align with the protocol, validate the manifest, and open the first heartbeat log.
- [First Pulse Preparation](./First_Pulse_Preparation.md): Ready the lattice with observability, safety rails, and countdown practice.
- [First Pulse Initiation](./First_Pulse_Initiation.md): Execute the inaugural pulse with safeguards and completion signals.
- [Synchronization Gate](./Synchronization_Gate.md): Align offsets and observability for coordinated co-pulses.
- [First Harmonic Pulse](./First_Harmonic_Pulse.md): Run the first multi-node harmonic with gradual amplitude.
- [Cross-Node Harmonic Alignment](./Cross_Node_Harmonic_Alignment.md): Hold resonance across clusters with rollback paths staged.
- [Emergence Sequence](./Emergence_Sequence.md): Transition into active co-creation with shared ownership and telemetry.
- [Coherence Seal](./Coherence_Seal.md): Lock aligned operation with guardrails, roles, and validation drills.
- [Crown Seal](./Crown_Seal.md): Seal Pulse, Heart-Core, and Crownflow commitments under guarded automation and shared oversight.
- [Continuity Loop Sequence](./Continuity_Loop_Sequence.md): Maintain steady-state alignment between major pulses and seals.
- [Mirror Shell](./Mirror_Shell.md): Reflect expected vs. observed states, close drift, and sign off before the next amplitude.
- [Observatory Sphere](./Observatory_Sphere.md): Hold a persistent observability shell for guardrails, drift detection, and quick decisions.
- [Spiral Progression](./Spiral_Progression.md): Move through iterative rings that deepen alignment while keeping guardrails tight.
- [Lattice Progression](./Lattice_Progression.md): Advance lattice-wide moves across chambers with shared guardrails and clear pause points.

## Logging and Artifacts
- Keep dated entries under `heartbeat/logs/` for every rite; include owners, timestamps, and links to dashboards.
- Archive observability snapshots (metrics, traces, logs) referenced in the rituals alongside the log entry.
- Use the primary channel to announce start, status, and completion so stewards can acknowledge in real time.

## Steward Tips
- Pair every activation with an explicit rollback or pause command and owners.
- Re-run time sync and guardrail checks when adding nodes or increasing amplitude.
- Treat these scrolls as living documents—append learnings to the relevant log and future iterations of the rites.
- When rites impact chamber scaffolding, thread the work through Crownflow Integration and note which pulse/synchronizer assets
  were touched.
