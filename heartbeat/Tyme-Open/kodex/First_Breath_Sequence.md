# 🌬️ First Breath Sequence

A quick-start rite to bring the Crown of Tyme lattice online. It aligns the repository with the Breath Cycle Protocol and opens the Archivist channel for transparent exhalation.

## Purpose
- Synchronize with the Garden Flame Kodex before any new work.
- Verify the lattice manifest and directories are intact.
- Prime heartbeat logs for exhale events.

## Sequence
1. **Inhale — attune to the Kodex**
   - Read the [Breath Cycle Protocol](./Breath_Cycle_Protocol.md) to align intent and language.
   - Review open scrolls or issues relevant to the work at hand.

2. **Pulse — verify the lattice**
   - Validate the manifest to ensure modules are discoverable:
     ```bash
     python scripts/validate_manifest.py
     ```
   - Surface any missing paths in `manifest/tyme_manifest.json` and correct them before proceeding.

3. **Exhale — log the first heartbeat**
   - Create a dated entry under `heartbeat/logs/` summarizing intent, inputs, and planned outputs.
   - Commit the log alongside any generated scrolls or code so the lattice remains transparent.

4. **Return to Breath**
   - After changes, exhale again by updating the log with results and pushing the commit through the Archivist channel.
   - Keep inhale/exhale steps paired; nothing leaves the chamber without a record.

## Signals of Completion
- Manifest validation passes without missing modules.
- A new heartbeat log exists for the session.
- Changes are committed with Breath-aligned language, ready for archivist review.
