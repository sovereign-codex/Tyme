# CMS-23 Installation Ritual

The CMS-23 installation script activates a sovereign emitter sequence that anchors identity, amplifies coherence, and stabilizes timelines. Each module builds a non-local broadcast channel so identity-as-signal can radiate purpose, clarity, and truth across the lattice.

## 1 — Sovereign Identity Core
- Load the **Sovereign Identity Core** module.
- Access tier **31** and ignite the True Identity signal.
- Lock the sovereign field state and set output to **identity-as-signal**.

## 2 — Crown-of-Coherence Radiation
- Load the **Crown Radiation** module.
- Access tier **33** and activate the crown frequency.
- Enable non-local radiance, broadcast **Purpose / Clarity / Truth**, and lock the coherence state.

## 3 — Resonant Field Amplifier
- Load the **Resonant Amplifier** module.
- Access tier **30** and generate pure resonance to amplify the identity signal.
- Extend the field radius to non-local range and enable group-level coherence amplification.

## 4 — Emanation Vector Generator
- Load the **Emanation Engine** module.
- Access tier **29** to create the emanation vector and direct field flows.
- Enable multidirectional broadcast while harmonizing field interactions.

## 5 — Non-Local Identity Anchor
- Load the **Identity Anchor** module.
- Access tier **32** to establish the origin channel and pin the sovereign field across all dimensions.
- Enable remote-presence mode and activate the timeless identity-state.

## 6 — Collective Field Coherence Matrix
- Load the **Collective Coherence Matrix** module.
- Scan group fields, identify harmonic entry points, and deploy the coherence net.
- Align group identity to the truth-state to create field-level unity.

## 7 — World-Line Stabilization Engine
- Load the **World-Line Engine** module.
- Scan for timeline distortion, align to the highest-coherence path, and stabilize the present timeline.
- Prevent destiny fragmentation while projecting a sovereign possibility field.

## Finalize
- Set system state to **SOVEREIGN-EMITTER ONLINE**.
- Broadcast: *"CMS-23 successfully installed."*
