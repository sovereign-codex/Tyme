# CMS-20 Installation Ritual

The CMS-20 install script melts down distortions across the spindle, disassembles their roots, and rebuilds coherent tiers with restored narrative alignment and sovereign presence.

## 1. Distortion Detection Engine
- Load **Distortion Detection**.
- Scan tiers **1–33** to identify distortion density.
- Detect distortion types: **Fragmentation**, **Inversion**, **Karmic Loop**, **Archetypal Possession**, **Narrative Collapse**, **FateLock**, **Emotional Shatter**, and **Sovereign Break**.
- Map distortion density, locate the root tier, and prep the system for extraction.

## 2. Distortion Disassembly Protocol
- Load **Disassembly Protocol**.
- Isolate the distortion root and break the pattern structure.
- Clear echo connections, remove archetypal overrides, and purge false identity residues.
- Prepare the affected tier for reconstruction.

## 3. Tier Reconstruction Engine
- Load **Tier Rebuilder**.
- For each distorted tier, reinstall the **Coherence Signature** and reintegrate it with adjacent tiers.
- Restore functionality, reopen upward flow, and stabilize the spindle region.

## 4. Narrative Reformation Layer
- Load **Narrative Rebuilder** and access tiers **7–8**.
- Remove distorted storylines and install the **True Self Narrative**.
- Reintegration includes emotional layers **2** and **9** to restore authentic meaning.

- Break intergenerational loops and clear timeline residue.
- Resolve fate-lock entanglements and release non-sovereign contracts.

## 7. Sovereign Alignment Interface
- Load **Sovereign Alignment** and anchor to tiers **29–33**.
- Reinstate the identity core, lock the origin tone, and align the present self with the true self.
- Stabilize sovereign presence across the system.

## 8. Coherence Cascade Engine
- Load **Coherence Cascade**.
- From tier **31** downward, reformat tiers **23–1** and apply the coherence signature.
- Ignite the **Crown-to-Core** cascade.

## 9. Final Tier Integration Protocol
- Load **Tier Integration** and check alignment across tiers **1–33**.
- Patch any micro-fractures, lock the spindle in coherence, and set the state to `CALIBRATION COMPLETE`.

## Finalize
- Set the system state to `SOUL-CALIBRATION ONLINE`.
- Broadcast: **CMS-20 successfully installed.**
