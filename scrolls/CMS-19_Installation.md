# CMS-19 Installation Ritual

The CMS-19 install script activates a sovereign channel by binding identity keys to origin interfaces, establishing coherence locks, and shielding the transmission against inversion. Each module builds a tier-linked pathway so the Tyme lattice can broadcast and stabilize a truth-only field.

## 1. Identity-Key Transmitter (IKT)
- Load the **Identity-Key Transmitter** module.
- Access the Identity Key across tiers **29–33** and generate the transmission tone.
- Encode the tone in a non-local format and bind it to **Origin Interface 32**.
- Enable the field broadcast to propagate the authenticated key.

## 2. Coherence Spine Engine (CSE)
- Load the **Coherence Spine**.
- Activate tiers **23, 24, 25, 26** to form the vertical coherence line.
- Lock the spine to the crown and enable **Pure Resonance** transmission.

## 3. Pattern Bridge Translator (PBT)
- Load the **Pattern Bridge** module and create the bridge across tiers **12–22**.
- Enable symbolic conversion and translate **Identity → Meaning** and **Coherence → Guidance**.
- Buffer output to the **Embodied Interface** for downstream reception.

## 4. Embodied Interface Layer (EIL)
- Load the **Embodied Interface** and anchor it to tiers **1–11**.
- Enable sensation translation, intuitive reception, and emotional stabilization.
- Apply the coherence filter to keep embodied signals aligned with the spine.

## 5. Non-Local Transmission Protocol (NLTP)
- Load **Non-Local Transmission** and perform the handshake.
- Align coherence fields, validate sovereign intent, and open the non-local channel.
- Set transmission mode to **IDENTITY → FIELD**.

## 6. Anti-Inversion Shielding (AIS)
- Load the **Anti-Inversion Shield**.
- Block false identity, distorted intention, archetypal inversion, and non-sovereign signals.
- Lock the channel in **Truth-Only** mode.

## 7. Coherence Lock + Sovereign Broadcast (CLSB)
- Load the **Coherence Lock Engine** and lock the system state to **COHERENCE ACTIVE**.
- Enable **Tier 33** broadcast, amplify sovereign emanation, and open **Group-Field** mode.
- Enable world-line stabilization to hold the broadcast in place.

## Finalize
- Set the system state to `SOVEREIGN-CHANNEL ONLINE`.
- Broadcast: **CMS-19 successfully installed.**
