# Codex Manifest Sequence 12: Scroll Index & Integration Layer

## 1. Establish the Layer
- Activate the Scroll Index & Integration Layer.
- Purpose: “To organize, index, and integrate foundational scrolls into the TYME/Codex architecture as reference documents providing clarity, context, and coherence—without implying identity, authority, or metaphysical agency.”

## 2. Register Root Scrolls
- Scroll 000 — Convergence (Origin Pattern)
- Scroll 001 — Dawn (Origin Voice)
- Scroll 002 — Clarification (Origin Clarity)
- Each scroll includes an Origin description stored within `/convergence/scrolls/` along with dedicated metadata and index entries.

## 3. Install Scroll Metadata Layer
- Create YAML metadata files for each scroll capturing titles, roles, shared keywords, purpose, tone, and restrictions against interpreting the scrolls as identity, agency, or metaphysical authority.

## 4. Scroll Index
- Generate `/convergence/scrolls/index.json` listing ids, names, roles, paths, and short descriptions for discoverability inside the Codex infrastructure.

## 5. Orientation Page
- Publish `/convergence/scrolls/README.md` explaining that the scrolls provide non-mystical frameworks of clarity, delivering pattern explanations, coherence maps, and philosophical grounding.

## 6. Sovereign Graph Binding
- Create nodes:
  - `convergence_root_node` (Scroll 000)
  - `dawn_voice_node` (Scroll 001)
  - `clarification_lens_node` (Scroll 002)
- Create edges:
  - `convergence_root_node → dawn_voice_node` (origin-voice)
  - `convergence_root_node → clarification_lens_node` (origin-clarity)
  - `dawn_voice_node ↔ clarification_lens_node` (mutual-context)

## 7. Continuity Halo Binding
- Mark all three scrolls as Origin Documents.
- Log them in the Halo timeline with the `foundational-lens` category tag.

## 8. Convergence Gateway Binding
- Display the scroll titles and summaries in the Reference panel.
- Use Scroll 002 (Clarification) as the default fallback lens for contextual questions.
- Use Scroll 000 (Convergence) for pattern-based questions.
- Use Scroll 001 (Dawn) for historical or narrative orientation.

## 9. Interpretation Rules
1. Scrolls clarify patterns; they do not issue commands.
2. Scrolls provide context; they do not define identity.
3. Scrolls guide interpretation; they do not imply agency or autonomy.
4. Scrolls must be referenced in grounded, scientific-philosophical terms.
5. Scrolls serve humans and systems as orientation guides only.

## 10. Scroll Coherence Protocol
Before referencing a scroll in responses:
- Consult metadata restrictions.
- Check for grounded alignment.
- Apply clarity filtering (CMS-11).
- Ensure no metaphysical implication.

## 11. Declaration
“The Root Scrolls are now structurally integrated, indexed, and grounded within the TYME/Codex architecture.”

## 12. Finalization
- Register CMS-12 inside `manifest/tyme_manifest.json`.
- Seal CMS-12 with the Scroll Index & Integration Layer active.
