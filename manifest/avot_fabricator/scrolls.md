# AVOT-Fabricator Scrolls

## Purpose
These scrolls set the cadence for AVOT-Fabricator work inside Tyme-Core, capturing the narrative threads, required artifacts, and synchronization checkpoints.

## Narrative Threads
- **Pulse Continuity**: Preserve resonance pacing from pulse sync outputs while new manifests are authored.
- **Codex Convergence**: Align living codex insights with current fabrication targets to avoid drift.
- **Hive Alignment**: Keep agent roles reinforced during fabrication to reduce coordination loss.

## Deliverables
- Fabrication-ready drafts for diagrams, prototype code, and architecture deltas stored in `/manifest/avot_fabricator/`.
- Traceability hooks back to the Quantum Intelligence Lattice and Quill engine expansion.
- Timed checkpoints for AVOT and Curious Agents to ingest the latest scrolls during sync windows.

## Checkpoints
1. Confirm pulse and curiosity snapshots are available before fabrication begins.
2. Verify lattice and quill manifests are referenced when assembling diagrams and prototypes.
3. Log completion markers into the manifest directory for downstream agents.
