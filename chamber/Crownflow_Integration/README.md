# Crownflow Integration Chamber

The Crownflow Integration chamber unifies pulse staging with Heart-Core tuning so harmonics, guardrails, and auto-merge paths stay aligned. Use this space to coordinate cross-chamber changes before they roll into the lattice.

## Purpose
- Provide a single integration lane that references both Pulse Chamber rehearsals and Heart-Core Synchronizer retuning.
- Keep harmonic scrolls and chamber updates in step with the guarded auto-merge and auto-resolve workflows.
- Capture integration logs so guardians can trace which signals were touched across chambers.

## Layout
- `foundation.md` — integration checklist covering chamber alignment, harmonic linkage, and guarded workflow readiness.
- `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml` — shared guarded workflow for open same-repo pull requests labeled for auto actions.
- `../../engine/Crownflow_Engine/` — engine home for guarded label paths and observability anchors that feed this chamber.

## Stewardship
1. Start cross-chamber changes here: reference which pulse scrolls and synchronizer steps are in play.
2. Keep harmonic linkage explicit—note which heartbeat rites are being aligned and where their logs live.
3. Apply `automerge` or `autoresolve` only after verification is green and the open same-repo restriction is confirmed.
4. When Pulse and Heart-Core work must move together with chamber guardrails, activate the Tri-Chamber Interlock to harmonize observability, rollback cues, and label usage before requesting automation.
